                                       In banking sector client(customer) satisfaction is the most important. So we  need to provide the satisfaction for the customers in the banking otherwise they leave the bank and its effect our business .Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving. Here the biggest challenge is to identify which customer is satisfied and which customer is unsatisfied . According to the 2020 reports Santander bank having 148 million customers . It is not possible to manually check those 148 million customers (incase it is possible we need to spent high amount).
                                      
                                      So Santander Bank is asking kagglers to help them to identify the unsatisfied customers as early as possible then management taken care of those clients(customers) to providing their requirements like improve the existing plans or improve banking services , policies or creating  awareness to them about the existing or useful plans .....etc. Management try to prevent them from  leaving the bank.

                                  This problem is a binary classification problem with Target label . Here the target label is the dependent variable(feature) we need to predict the TARGET column based on the independent variables(features). Target label denoting unsatisfied customers with 1 and satisfied customers with 0.

Developing a machine learning model with good performance and trusting the model. generally In the banks customer satisfaction is a key measure of success so the best model in our sense is to try to increase the customer satisfaction rate and try to reduce the dissatisfaction rate.

                                 So we need to develop a MachineLearning classification model and this model can able to classify  whether the customer is satisfied or unsatisfied when we are providing the customer information inform of text file.
